This repository contains the R code to reproduce the results presented in [Semiparametrically Efficient Stepped Wedge Designs](TBD).

### Quickstart

To reproduce the results, please download this repo on a machine with R, run each of R script in the [`codes`](codes) without modification, and then the results are saved in [`figures`](figures), [`results`](results), and [`tables`](tables). All the R scripts can be run standalone. To run the R scripts, you do not need to set any pathnames; everything is relative. Only standard libraries (doRNG, doSNOW, dplyr, foreach, ggpattern, ggplot2, glmmTMB, lme4, MASS, nloptr, parallel, patchwork, RColorBrewer, RSSthemes, tidyverse, xtable) are required in the R scripts.

### Application to the Mobile Health Study

### Helper Functions Are Collected in [`codes`](codes) 

The following scripts collect all the helper functions used in this repository. You do not need to separately run any of the scripts to replicate the results in the paper.
