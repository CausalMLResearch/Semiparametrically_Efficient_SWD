# Semiparametrically Efficient Stepped Wedge Designs
This repository contains the R code to reproduce the results presented in [Semiparametrically Efficient Stepped Wedge Designs](TBD).

### Quickstart

To reproduce the results, please download this repo on a machine with R, run each of R script in the [`code`](code) without modification, and then the results are saved in [`figures`](figures), [`results`](results), [`tables`](tables). All the R scripts can be run standalone. To run the R scripts, you do not need to set any pathnames; everything is relative. Only standard libraries (TBD) are required in the R scripts.
